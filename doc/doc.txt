Tables

A table is nothing more than a means of organizing data in rows and columns.
This concept has been present in our society for a long period of time and has
been adopted by HTML in its early stages, as a way of conveying information that
would otherwise not be so easily understood.

In HTML documents a table can be considered, briefly, as a group of rows where
each one contains a group of cells. This is conceptually different from a column
group containing a row group, and this difference will have an impact on the
composition and behavior of the table.

Like many other HTML structures, tables are built using elements.
In particular, a basic table can be declared using three elements,
namely table (the main container), tr (representing the cell-containing rows)
and td (representing the cells).
